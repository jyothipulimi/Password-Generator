# 🔐 Password Generator (Python)

This is a simple and effective Python script that generates a secure, random password of a user-defined length.  
It uses Python’s built-in `random` and `string` libraries to include uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

## 📌 Features

- Generates strong passwords with letters, numbers, and special symbols.
- Input validation included (checks for numeric and positive input).
- Simple and lightweight script (easy to run on any system with Python installed).

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The script asks the user to input the desired password length.
2. It checks if the entered length is a valid number and greater than 0.
3. It generates a password by randomly choosing characters from:
   - Uppercase & lowercase alphabets
   - Digits (0–9)
   - Special characters (!@#$%^&*...)
